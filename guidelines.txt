General guidelines :
====================

1) Report the results as an appendix in your written report. Note that appendix is not included
       in the written report page limit (5-10 pages).
2) In case you have more than 1 algorithm, report the results for each algorithm separately.
       e.g. if you have two algorithms A1 and A2, report results first for algorithm A1 and then algorithm A2.
3) Statistics of your algorithm to report :
       for each algorithm and problem instance report (do not average/summarize over problem instances; report for each problem instance separately) :
       -) runtime (cpu time) of your program
       -) in case of (systematic) state-space search, number of search space nodes expanded/generated
       -) in case of backtracking search, number of search space nodes generated/pruned and number of backtracks
       -) in case of local search (e.g. greedy local search, simulated annealing, etc.), number of steps/flips/moves
       -) in case of genetic algorithm, population size and number of iterations
4) Evaluation :
       1st place = 5 pts
       2nd place = 3 pts
       3rd place = 1 pt

N-queens
========

find the largest N such that you can solve this problem in 300 seconds.
report :
       1) value of N (timeout 300 sec)
       2) a zip file of a solution for the N given in (1) in the format described on the class webpage
       3) algorithm statistics

Sudoku
======

for each of the 8 benchmark problems
report :
       1) a solution in the format described on the class webpage
       2) algorithm statistics
please note that for readability, the input problems in sudoku.txt are organized as 9x9 grids, one row per line, with commas separating the values.

Mastermind
==========

for each of the 6 benchmark problems,
report :
       1) number of guesses
       2) algorithm statistics
please note that problem definitions are in files sokoban0.txt-sokoban5.txt; for testing purposes, a visual representation of the problems are in input0.txt-input5.txt.

Sokoban
=======

for each of the 6 benchmark problems,
report :
       1) a solution in the format described on the class webpage
       2) number of steps/moves in the plan you find to move boxes to storage locations
       3) algorithm statistics
